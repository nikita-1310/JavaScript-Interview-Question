## Q1. What is JavaScript ?
**Ans.** JavaScript is a scripting language, which is used to make web application interactive. It is an interpreted language, which means it does not need a compiler to translate code. It is used as a frontend & backend both.

## Q2. How does JavaScript work ?
**Ans.** The web browser loads a web page, parses the HTML, and creates what is known as a Document Object Model (DOM) from the contents. The DOM presents a live view of the web page to your JavaScript code.

The browser will then grab everything linked to the HTML, like images and CSS files. The CSS information comes from the CSS parser.

The HTML and CSS are put together by the DOM to create the web page first. Then, the browsers' JavaScript engine loads JavaScript files and inline code but does not run the code immediately. It waits for the HTML and CSS to finish loading.

Once this is done, the JavaScript is executed in the order the code is written. This results in the DOM being updated by JavaScript code and rendered by the browser.

The order here is important. If the JavaScript did not wait for the HTML and CSS to finish, it would not be able to change.

## Q3. Is JavaScript static type or dynamic typed language?
**Ans.** JavaScript is a dynamic typed language because a variable value is checked during runtime. It is an interpreted language, which means it does not need a compiler to translate code. & single threaded because it executes the code line by line.
